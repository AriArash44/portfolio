# Personal Portfolio Website

This project is a responsive, multilingual portfolio website built with React. It showcases development skills, interactive UI components, and thoughtful cross-browser optimizations (Due to performance differences between Chromium-based and Mozilla-based browsers, a specific component was modified to reduce animation intensity in Chromium environments while maintaining usability and visual integrity.). The site supports both Persian and English languages, both dark and light theme, and is designed to be fast, accessible, and visually engaging.
